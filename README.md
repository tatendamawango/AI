## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### ðŸ“Š 1. Data Quality Analysis
**Notebook:** `data-quality-analysis.ipynb`  
Analyzes the quality of a real-world dataset, covering:
- Summary statistics for continuous and categorical variables
- Distribution visualizations (histograms, boxplots, SPLOM)
- Missing value and outlier detection
- Correlation analysis and matrix heatmaps
- Data normalization and encoding techniques

### ðŸ“ˆ 2. Neural Network Forecasting (AR Model)
**Notebook:** `neural-network-forecasting.ipynb`  
Implements a single-layer artificial neuron (linear activation) to predict future time series values based on prior observations. The project covers:
- Historical sunspot data forecasting
- Matrix formation for time-lag inputs
- Model training (direct + iterative)
- Forecast error analysis and histogram
- MSE and MAD evaluation

### ðŸ¤– 3. ANN Classification with Cross-Validation
**Notebook:** `ann-classification-crossvalidation.ipynb`  
Trains an artificial neural network (ANN) for classification tasks:
- Target selection and label preprocessing
- 10-fold cross-validation
- Learning rate tuning and architecture changes
- Performance comparison and optimization

### ðŸ“¨ 4. Bayesian Spam Detection
**Notebook:** `bayesian-spam-classifier.ipynb`  
Builds a Naive Bayes-based text classifier to distinguish SPAM vs. HAM:
- Custom token parsing with regex
- Spamicity calculation for tokens
- Hash table-based word tracking
- N-gram sensitivity testing (e.g., N=8,16,32)
- Accuracy, false positive, and false negative analysis

### ðŸ“Œ 5. Final Project (Optional/Capstone)
**Notebook:** `final-project-summary.ipynb`  
Summarizes all labs or explores an advanced topic â€” may include:
- Model comparison
- Combined classifiers
- Visualization dashboard or UI integration
